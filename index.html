            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>How can we make people feel more comfortable when they are most vulnerable? Our group aims to help people
                determine which bathroom on campus is right for them. Depending on the user, some bathrooms may meet
                their sufficient needs while others do not. Some factors to consider are gender neutrality, stall size,
                privacy, and overall proximity. As of right now, it is hard to find a definitive list of the bathrooms
                on campus that also describe the features it offers. For instance, in more urgent scenarios, a user may
                need to find the nearest bathroom that offers free personal hygiene products. In these kinds of
                situations, the knowledge of what bathroom is conveniently available and equipped with necessary
                features can affect the results of the rest of the day. A previous solution to this problem was a blog
                called UW Bathrooms which ran from 2012 to 2016. As such, it has not been updated in 6 years and the
                bathroom descriptions and ratings have become outdated. Thus, the goal of Rate My Bathroom is to support
                our current communityâ€™s public health, promote personal hygiene, and ultimately make our campus a more
                accessible place. </p>
