            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>
                How can we make people feel more comfortable when they are most vulnerable? Our group aims to help people
                determine which bathroom on campus is right for them. Depending on the user, some bathrooms may meet
                their sufficient needs while others do not. Some factors to consider are gender neutrality, stall size,
                privacy, and overall proximity. As of right now, it is hard to find a definitive list of the bathrooms
                on campus that also describe the features it offers. For instance, in more urgent scenarios, a user may
                need to find the nearest bathroom that offers free personal hygiene products. In these kinds of
                situations, the knowledge of what bathroom is conveniently available and equipped with necessary
                features can affect the results of the rest of the day. A previous solution to this problem was a blog
                called <a href="https://uwbathrooms.netlify.app/" target="_blank"> UW Bathrooms</a> which ran from 2012 to 2016. As
                such, it has not been updated in 6 years and the
                bathroom descriptions and ratings have become outdated. Thus, the goal of Dub Dumps is to support
                our current community's public health, promote personal hygiene, and ultimately make our campus a more
                accessible place.

            <h2>App Description</h2>
            <p>
                Our application will mainly direct its focus towards the students of the University of Washington. It will be helpful for students in their time of need, where they need to urgently find a bathroom worthy of their standards before and after classes. However, our website could also branch out to include guests of UW who want to find suitable public bathrooms they can use while visiting the campus. Our users will be able to view information about the campus' bathrooms, including their location, description, reviews from other users, and the overall rating. The original location data will be collected from UW's <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/ceogis/Public/Accessibility/Map/" target="_blank"> public accessibility maps</a>, UW's <a href="https://sites.uw.edu/qcenter/wiki/gender-neutral-bathrooms/" target="_blank">existing gender neutral bathroom maps</a>, and personal experience from our group.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In our website, users will be able to create an account using their email, allowing them to save the locations of the bathrooms they've previously visited and enjoyed, promoting personal efficiency and customization. Created accounts will also be able to rate the bathrooms and provide reviews, so that they can contribute to the community of UW's public hygiene. Finally, the application will have a search function, where users can filter through bathrooms on campus that may or may not fit their needs, such as having a high enough cleanliness rating, being gender neutral, or relative proximity to their location. This interaction will create a more optimized experience for the user so that they can find the bathroom they personally need. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Using this app will help improve student's lives during their school day by providing them with the bathroom information they need. As of now, there are no bathroom rating applications out there geared towards the UW campus, and the ones that partially solve this are blogs that are outdated, may be misrepresented, and have no user functions. Our app will provide an updated look at our campus bathrooms, with reviews being up-to-date so that users know exactly what to expect when walking into the bathroom. Everyone needs to use the bathroom every day, so hopefully our app will be a reliable help for students looking to meet their needs so that they can feel safe and comfortable.
